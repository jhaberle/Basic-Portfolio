    <p>
        Hi there, my name is Jake Haberle.  I am 34 years old
        and I grew up in Parker, Colorado.  I have a beautiful wife, Heather,
        along with two boys Josh (4),and Dylan (1 1/2).  I love my family more than life itself
        eventhough they are making my hair fall out and taking years off of my life.
        If I ever have free time, I absolutely love going skiing, watching the Broncos 
        and concocting new whiskey coctails!

        I currently work at Empower Retirement in Investment Operations as a 
        Valuations Analyst.  I enjoy my role quite a bit, however, many functions
        within our team are being out-sourced.  I need to up-skill and I have always 
        been fascinated in coding and website development.  The time is now to figure it out!
